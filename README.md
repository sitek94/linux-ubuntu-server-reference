I was inspired by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFjYzhkEBys) and decided to turn my old laptop into a web server that I could use for learning purposes.

## Linux

All my life I've been using Windows and I decided that it'd be nice to try something else.

## Ubuntu Server

As a Linux distribution I've chosen Ubuntu Server.

* [Disable Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot) - to boot PC using USB

The only problem I had with the installation was that my laptop doesn't have an Ethernet Port, so I had to manually enable wifi, which wasn't so straightforward for me.

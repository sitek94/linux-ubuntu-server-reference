# HP T610

Specs of the one I own:

```
Processor: AMD G-T56N 1,65 GHz DUAL CORE
RAM: 2 GB DDR3
HDD: WD WD3200BEKT 320GB SATA III 2,5"
Ports: DVI, 4x USB 2.0; 2x USB 3.0, GbE LAN, RS-232
```

Ubuntu Server system requirements:
```
1 GHz CPU
1 GiB RAM (system memory)
2.5 GB hard drive
```

>Since everything on an Ubuntu 22.04 server is done by the command line, the lack of a GUI and its many dependencies means that the minimum system requirements are far lower.
